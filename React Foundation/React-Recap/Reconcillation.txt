Reconciliation:-When developer give state to Rect 
React write DOM code instead of you

Reconciliation is a process of getting the new state from developer
and checking with existing state is there any difference 
putting things in DOM


Can you do you taxes yourself
Can you do DOM maninpulation yourself?

Answer is Yes

you give react state and then re-render happen
Any time you change the state in application 
React re-render 
Ex:- Basic Code in React
import {useState} from 'react'

function App()
{   
    const [count,setCount]=useState(0);
    return
    <>
    <button onClick={()=>{setCount(count+1)}}>{count}</button
    </>
}
Reconciliation is React's way of diffing 
the virtual DOM tree with the updated 
virtual DOM to determine the most efficient
way to update the real DOM
